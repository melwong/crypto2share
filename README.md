# crypto2share

## What is this?
To let anyone with cryptocurrencies to send anyone else some of their cryptos as a gift. We support over 570 cryptocurrencies!

Each crypto is delivered via email inside a newly generated digital wallet (paper wallet). The public address and private key are sent with the email, including the amount of crypto given by the sender and market value of their crypto.

## Purpose
We feel that the best way to get people to be interested about something is giving them a gift that would spark their curiosity. Thus, we want to help educate those who are not yet touched by cryptocurrency by offering them gifts in the form of cryptos.

## Security
No wallet data is stored in the server and no database is used. Code is designed to prevent XSS and SQL injection. Every user input is valdiated and sanitized. Webpages are checked to ensure they always run under SSL secured environment.
