## What is this?
To let anyone with cryptocurrencies to send anyone some of their cryptos as a gift. We support over 570 cryptocurrencies!

Each crypto is delivered via email inside a newly generated digital wallet (paper wallet). The public address and private key is sent with the email, including the amount of crypto given by the sender and market value of their crypto.
