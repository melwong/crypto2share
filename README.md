# crypto2share

## Purpose
To help educate those who are not yet touched by cryptocurrency by offering them gifts in the form of cryptos. Anyone with cryptocurrencies could send their family and friends some of their cryptos for free. We support over 570 cryptocurrencies. Each crypto is delivered via email inside a newly generated digital wallet (paper wallet). The public address and private key is sent with the email, including the amount of crypto given by the sender.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to https://github.com/koraycoding/paper-wallet for providing the paper wallet codes.
