To let anyone with cryptocurrencies to send anyone else some of their cryptos as a gift. We support over 570 cryptocurrencies!

## How it works
Each crypto is delivered via email together with a newly generated digital wallet (paper wallet) containing the crypto.

Sender only needs to send the amount of crypto to the new wallet and fill in a form with recipient's name and email address with a message. The email will be delivered immediately with the wallet's public address and private key and its crypto content (with market value). The email also comes with beginner's tutorials about cryptocurrency.

## Security
No wallet data or email address is stored and no database is used. Outbound emails are not logged. Code is designed to prevent XSS and SQL injection. Javascript files are protected with subresource integrity (SRI). Every user input is validated and sanitized. Webpages are checked to ensure they always run under SSL secured environment.

## Purpose
We feel that the best way to get people to be interested about something is giving them a gift that would spark their curiosity. Thus, we want to help educate those who are not yet touched by cryptocurrency by offering them cryptos as gifts.

## Special thanks
